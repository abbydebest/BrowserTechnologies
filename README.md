## Introduction
For this assignemnt we had to rebuild a PDF version of a tax file into an interactive website. With a focus on usability on all sorts of devices and browsers.

# 🫶🏼 Week 1

## Assignment choice
The inherantence tax report is an extremely complicated process the user has to go through. From my perspective, as a user(or tax payer) and UX/UI designer the process is already being complicated from the start, more than it has to be. For this reason, I want to simplify this start so that the user will start the process with more confidence and can easily continue on with the more complicated parts. I also find it interesting to look at the part of the inherentance share and information and I might also elaborate this into an interactive form.
